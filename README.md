**DISCLAIMER** this is my first `python` project (**dated 2012!**) of ever, so *please* be kind if you read the code.

# expert-system interpreter

In **Artificial Intelligence**, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. 
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as ifâ€“then rules rather than through conventional procedural code.

`Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.`

This repo is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. 

The knowledge base represents facts and rules. 

The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.
